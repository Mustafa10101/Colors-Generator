# Colors Generator

## Description

`Colors Generator` is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It generates random colors upon pressing the `spacebar`. There's also the feature to `lock` a certain color to prevent it from changing in the new color generation and to copy the color value to the clipboard.

## Installation

To use `Colors Generator`, simply clone this repository to your computer with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_account/colors-generator.git
```

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will see 5 blocks, each representing a color. Press the spacebar to generate new random colors. If you want to "lock" a certain color, click on the lock icon in the corresponding block. To copy the color value, click on the color itself.
